    <string name="app_name">AA Aux</string>
    <string name="explanation">This App is designed to use your device\'s audio input as an auxiliary input when using Android Auto. This is useful because most AA Head Units do not have Aux Input, and on most Head Units Bluetooth is used for Android Auto. This means it is inconvenient for passengers play music, as AA must be disconnected or connected to their phone. This app allows a passenger to play music through a conventional aux cord, whilst allowing the driver to keep using Android Auto on their own phone. The driver also retains control over the volume, and can "mute" the aux input by using the stop button. To get an auxiliary input into your phone, you may need to buy a headphone/microphone jack splitter, and plug it into the microphone port. The button below can be used to test the app, though the app is primarily designed to be operated via Android Auto.</string>
