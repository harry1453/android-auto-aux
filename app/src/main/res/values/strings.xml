    <string name="app_name">AA Aux</string>
    <string name="explanation">This app is designed to use your device\'s microphone input as an auxiliary input when using Android Auto. The reason for this is because most Head Units do not have aux in, and it is inconvenient for passengers to connect to Android Auto, and on most Head Units Bluetooth is used for Android Auto so that cannot be used either. This app allows a passenger to play music through a conventional aux cord, whilst allowing the driver to keep using Android Auto, for example when navigating. The driver also retains control over the volume, and can "mute" the aux input by using the stop button. To get an auxiliary input into your phone, you may need to buy a headphone/microphone jack splitter, and plug into the microphone port. The button below can be used to test the app, though the app is primarily designed to be operated via Android Auto.</string>
